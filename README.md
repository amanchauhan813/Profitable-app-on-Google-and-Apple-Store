# Profitable App Profiles for AppStore and Google Play

This project is about analyzing apps profitability in the AppStore and Google Play platfoms.

The Company builds free apps that depend on ads to make money therefore, the goal is to uderstand what apps are likely to attract more users, since  revenue for any given app is mostly influenced by the number of users who use the app and engage with the ads.

The dataset used for this analysis are listed below:
- [AppleStore.csv](https://www.kaggle.com/ramamet4/app-store-apple-data-set-10k-apps/home)
- [GooglePlaystore.csv](https://www.kaggle.com/lava18/google-play-store-apps/home)

## Dataset Opening and Exploration


```python
#opening AppleStore dataset
from csv import reader
opened_file = open('AppleStore.csv')
read_file = reader(opened_file)
appstore = list(read_file)
appstore_header = appstore[0]
appstore = appstore[1:]
```


```python
#opening Google Play dataset
from csv import reader
opened_file = open('googleplaystore.csv')
read_file = reader(opened_file)
googleplay = list(read_file)
googleplay_header = googleplay[0]
googleplay = googleplay[1:]
```


```python
#write funtion used to repeatedly to explore rows in a more readable
#way and  show the number of rows and columns for any data set.

def explore_data(dataset, start, end, rows_and_columns=False):
    dataset_slice = dataset[start:end]    
    for row in dataset_slice:
        print(row)
        print('\n') # adds a new (empty) line between rows
        
    if rows_and_columns:
        print('Number of rows:', len(dataset))
        print('Number of columns:', len(dataset[0]))
```


```python
#explore both dataset with explore_dataset fuction
print(appstore_header)
print('\n')
explore_data(appstore, 0, 3, True)



```

    Number of rows: 10841
    Number of columns: 13


Observe that Applestore has 7197 rows and 16 columns while Google play has 10841 row and 13 columns
The column we can identify as useful to our analysis in both datasets are as follow
 - **Appstore:** 'track_name', 'currency', 'price', 'rating_count_tot', 'rating_count_ver', and 'prime_genre'.
 
 - **Googleplay:** App', 'Category', 'Reviews', 'Installs', 'Type', 'Price', and 'Genres'.

## Data Cleaning
Before our analysis, we need to make sure the data we analyze is accurate, otherwise the results of our analysis will be wrong. Therefore we would need to take steps which involves,removing or correcting wrong data, removing duplicate data, modifying the data to fit the purpose of our analysis, etc.

In the [dicussion section](https://www.kaggle.com/lava18/google-play-store-apps/discussion) of the google data, [one of the dicussions](https://www.kaggle.com/lava18/google-play-store-apps/discussion/66015) decribes a error  of "wrong rating in a row 10472".




```python
print(googleplay_header)
print('\n')
print(googleplay[10472])
```

    ['App', 'Category', 'Rating', 'Reviews', 'Size', 'Installs', 'Type', 'Price', 'Content Rating', 'Genres', 'Last Updated', 'Current Ver', 'Android Ver']
    
    
    ['Life Made WI-Fi Touchscreen Photo Frame', '1.9', '19', '3.0M', '1,000+', 'Free', '0', 'Everyone', '', 'February 11, 2018', '1.0.19', '4.0 and up']


The corresponding value in row 10472 to the ratings header is 19. This proves that the error is true because the Google Playstore has a maximum rating of 5. 

We would then delete the row with the wrong data.


```python
del(googleplay[10472])
print(len(googleplay))
```

    10840


## Removing Duplicates (Part 1)

From the discussion section we also found out that some of the Google Play Apps have duplicates. For example, Instagram has multiple entries.:


```python
for app in googleplay:
    name = app[0]
    if name == 'Instagram':
        print(app)
    
```

    ['Instagram', 'SOCIAL', '4.5', '66577313', 'Varies with device', '1,000,000,000+', 'Free', '0', 'Teen', 'Social', 'July 31, 2018', 'Varies with device', 'Varies with device']
    ['Instagram', 'SOCIAL', '4.5', '66577446', 'Varies with device', '1,000,000,000+', 'Free', '0', 'Teen', 'Social', 'July 31, 2018', 'Varies with device', 'Varies with device']
    ['Instagram', 'SOCIAL', '4.5', '66577313', 'Varies with device', '1,000,000,000+', 'Free', '0', 'Teen', 'Social', 'July 31, 2018', 'Varies with device', 'Varies with device']
    ['Instagram', 'SOCIAL', '4.5', '66509917', 'Varies with device', '1,000,000,000+', 'Free', '0', 'Teen', 'Social', 'July 31, 2018', 'Varies with device', 'Varies with device']


To know the number of duplicate app in our Google play dataset we have to write the following code:


```python
google_duplicate = []
google_unique = []

for app in googleplay:
    name = app[0]
    if name in google_unique:
        google_duplicate.append(name)
    else:
        google_unique.append(name)
print('Number of duplicate apps in Google dataset:', len(google_duplicate))
print('\n')
print('Examples of duplicates in the google data set are:', google_duplicate[:10])
```

    Number of duplicate apps in Google dataset: 1181
    
    
    Examples of duplicates in the google data set are: ['Quick PDF Scanner + OCR FREE', 'Box', 'Google My Business', 'ZOOM Cloud Meetings', 'join.me - Simple Meetings', 'Box', 'Zenefits', 'Google Ads', 'Google My Business', 'Slack']


The duplicate rows can not be removed randomly. In the google duplicate apps printed above we can observe that the main difference is in the reviews column with different figures. Based on the number of reviews we can see that some rows  in the duplicates have more reviews than others. Therefore we can use this as a basis to justify which rows to delete. We would keep the rows with most reviews and delete the others bacause they are the latest.

Above we calculated the number of duplicates to be 1181. After removing the duplicates the number of row should be:


```python
print('Expected length:', len(googleplay) - 1181)
```

    Expected length: 9659


To remove the google play dataset duplicates:
- create a dictionary with unique app names and the dictionary key value would be the highest number of reviews
- Use the dictionary information to the create a new dataset which would have unique app with highest reviews.

## Removing Duplicates (Part 2)


```python
reviews_max = {}
for app in googleplay:
    name = app[0]
    n_reviews = float(app[3])
    
    if name in reviews_max and reviews_max[name] < n_reviews:
        reviews_max[name] = n_reviews
        
    elif name not in reviews_max:
        reviews_max[name] = n_reviews
        
    
```

Below we do a calculation to make sure our dictionary length is as expectes


```python
print('Expected length:', len(googleplay) - 1181)
print('Actual length:', len(reviews_max))
```

    Expected length: 9659
    Actual length: 9659


We will do use the dictionary to remove duplicate rows


```python
googleplay_clean = []
already_added = []

for app in googleplay:
    name = app[0]
    n_reviews = float(app[3])
    if (reviews_max[name] == n_reviews) and (name not in already_added):
        googleplay_clean.append(app)
        already_added.append(name)
```

Explore the newly cleaned Google Play dataset


```python
explore_data(googleplay_clean, 0, 3, True)
```

    ['Photo Editor & Candy Camera & Grid & ScrapBook', 'ART_AND_DESIGN', '4.1', '159', '19M', '10,000+', 'Free', '0', 'Everyone', 'Art & Design', 'January 7, 2018', '1.0.0', '4.0.3 and up']
    
    
    ['U Launcher Lite – FREE Live Cool Themes, Hide Apps', 'ART_AND_DESIGN', '4.7', '87510', '8.7M', '5,000,000+', 'Free', '0', 'Everyone', 'Art & Design', 'August 1, 2018', '1.2.4', '4.0.3 and up']
    
    
    ['Sketch - Draw & Paint', 'ART_AND_DESIGN', '4.5', '215644', '25M', '50,000,000+', 'Free', '0', 'Teen', 'Art & Design', 'June 8, 2018', 'Varies with device', '4.2 and up']
    
    
    Number of rows: 9659
    Number of columns: 13


## Removing Non-English Apps (Part 1)

We have also realized that some of the apps we are analyzing in the dataset may not be in english. Since we are only intrested in apps that cater to only english-speaking users, we will remove apps that are not in english. 

Examples of non-english apps in our dataset are:


```python
print(appstore[813][1])
print(appstore[6731][1])
print('\n')
print(googleplay_clean[4412][0])
print(googleplay_clean[7940][0])
```

    爱奇艺PPS -《欢乐颂2》电视剧热播
    【脱出ゲーム】絶対に最後までプレイしないで 〜謎解き＆ブロックパズル〜
    
    
    中国語 AQリスニング
    لعبة تقدر تربح DZ


The funtion below to takes in a string and uses the bulit-in ord() function to return False if there's any character in the string that doesn't belong to the set of common English characters, otherwise it returns True.


```python
def english(string):
    for each in string:
        if ord(each) > 127:
            return False
    return True
```


```python
print(english('instagram'))
print(english('爱奇艺PPS -《欢乐颂2》电视剧热播'))
print(english('Docs To Go™ Free Office Suite'))
print(english('Instachat 😜'))
```

    True
    False
    False
    False


The function seems to work fine, but some English app names use emojis or other symbols (™, — (em dash), – (en dash), etc.) that fall outside of the ASCII range. Because of this, we'll remove useful apps if we use the function in its current form.

To minimize the impact of data loss, we'll only remove an app if its name has more than three characters with corresponding numbers falling outside the ASCII range. This means all English apps with up to three emoji or other special characters will still be labeled as English. Our filter function is still not perfect, but it should be fairly effective. The fuction is edited below:


```python
def english(string):
    non_ascii = 0
    for each in string:
        if ord(each) > 127:
            non_ascii += 1
    
    if non_ascii > 3:
        return False
    else:
        return True
```


```python
print(english('instagram'))
print(english('爱奇艺PPS -《欢乐颂2》电视剧热播'))
print(english('Docs To Go™ Free Office Suite'))
print(english('Instachat 😜'))
```

    True
    False
    True
    True


## Removing Non-English Apps (Part 2)

Below we will use the new function to filter out non-English apps from both data sets. Loop through each data set, and if an app name is identified as English, then append the whole row to a separate list. Then explore the data sets and see how many rows are remaining for each data set.


```python
googleplay_english = [] 
appstore_english = []

for app in googleplay_clean:
    name = app[0]
    if english(name):
        googleplay_english.append(app)
        
for app in appstore:
    name = app[1]
    if english(name):
        appstore_english.append(app)
        
explore_data(googleplay_english, 0, 3, True)
print('\n')
explore_data(appstore_english, 0, 3, True)
```

    Number of rows: 6183
    Number of columns: 16


## Isolation of Free Apps

As we mentioned in the introduction, we are only intrested in free apps that make money from in-app ads. Since our datasets contain both free and non-free app we have to isolate the free apps. This would be our last step in the cleaning process


```python
appstore_free = []
googleplay_free = []

for app in appstore_english:
    app_price = app[4]
    if app_price == '0.0':
        appstore_free.append(app)
        
for app in googleplay_english:
    app_price = app[7]
    if app_price == '0':
        googleplay_free.append(app)

        
print(len(googleplay_free))
print(len(appstore_free))
```

    8864
    3222


## Most Common Apps

### Part 1

To minimize risks and overhead, our validation strategy for an app idea is comprised of three steps:

- Build a minimal Android version of the app, and add it to Google Play.
- If the app has a good response from users, we then develop it further.
- If the app is profitable after six months, we also build an iOS version of the app and add it to the App Store.

Because our end goal is to add the app on both the App Store and Google Play, we need to find app profiles that are successful on both markets. For instance, a profile that might work well for both markets might be a productivity app that makes use of gamification.

We will begin the analysis by getting a sense of what are the most common genres for each market. For this, we'll need to build frequency tables for a few columns in our data sets. Specifically, prime_genre column of the App Store data set, and the Genres and Category columns of the Google Play data set.

## Part 2

Create a function named freq_table() that takes in two inputs: dataset (which is expected to be a list of lists) and index (which is expected to be an integer). The function should return the frequency table (as a dictionary) for any column we want.The frequencies would also be expressed as percentages.


We would also create the display_table() function and use it to display the frequency table of the columns prime_genre, Genres, and Category. 





```python
def freq_table(dataset, index):
    table = {}
    total = 0
    
    for row in dataset:
        total += 1
        value = row[index]
        if value in table:
            table[value] += 1
        else:
            table[value] = 1
    
    table_percentages = {}
    for key in table:
        percentage = (table[key] / total) * 100
        table_percentages[key] = percentage 
    
    return table_percentages


def display_table(dataset, index):
    table = freq_table(dataset, index)
    table_display = []
    for key in table:
        key_val_as_tuple = (table[key], key)
        table_display.append(key_val_as_tuple)
        
    table_sorted = sorted(table_display, reverse = True)
    for entry in table_sorted:
        print(entry[1], ':', entry[0])
```

## Part 3

Firstly, we would analyze the frequency table we generated for the prime_genre column of the App Store data set to understand the following:
- The most common genre and the runner-up
- The patterns we can you see
- The general impression


```python
display_table(appstore_free, -5)
```

We observe that:
- More than a half (58.16%) of the english apps in the appstore  are games.
- Entertainment apps in the appstore rank second with just 7.3%, followed by photo and video apps which are about 5%. Only 3.66% of the apps are designed for education
- The general impression is that the educational, productivity and utility apps etc are not as commonly developed for the appstore as gaming, entertainement, and phot & video apps.

The trend appears to not be the same for the google play store. We can observe here that:
- Family apps make up about 19% of the total with games at 10% and tools at 8.5%.
- It also appears that apps for family, tools, business, lifestyle, productivity are more popular in the google play store.
- More practical apps have a bigger share of this app store market.

We can also futher understand this by examining the frequency table of the Genre column


```python
display_table(googleplay_free, -4)
```

## Most Popular Apps by Genre on the App Store

The frequency tables we analyzed in the previous screen showed us that the App Store is dominated by apps designed for fun, while Google Play shows a more balanced landscape of both practical and for-fun apps. Now, we'd like to get an idea about the kind of apps with the most users.

For the google play store we would calculate the average number of installs  for each app genre but we do not have a similar column in the apple appstore, therefore we would use we'll take the total number of user ratings as a proxy, which we can find in the rating_count_tot column.


```python
genres_ios = freq_table(appstore_free, -5)

for genre in genres_ios:
    total = 0
    len_genre = 0
    for app in appstore_free:
        genre_app = app[-5]
        if genre_app == genre:            
            n_ratings = float(app[5])
            total += n_ratings
            len_genre += 1
    avg_n_ratings = total / len_genre
    print(genre, ':', avg_n_ratings)
```

On average, navigation apps have the highest number of user reviews, but this figure is heavily influenced by Waze and Google Maps, which have close to half a million user reviews together:


```python
for app in appstore_free:
    if app[-5] == 'Navigation':
        print(app[1], ':', app[5]) # print name and number of ratings
```

    Waze - GPS Navigation, Maps & Real-time Traffic : 345046
    Google Maps - Navigation & Transit : 154911
    Geocaching® : 12811
    CoPilot GPS – Car Navigation & Offline Maps : 3582
    ImmobilienScout24: Real Estate Search in Germany : 187
    Railway Route Search : 5


The same pattern applies to social networking apps, where the average number is heavily influenced by a few giants like Facebook, Pinterest, Skype, etc. Same applies to music apps, where a few big players like Pandora, Spotify, and Shazam heavily influence the average number.

Our aim is to find popular genres, but navigation, social networking or music apps might seem more popular than they really are. The average number of ratings seem to be skewed by very few apps which have hundreds of thousands of user ratings, while the other apps may struggle to get past the 10,000 threshold. We could get a better picture by removing these extremely popular apps for each genre and then rework the averages, but we'll leave this level of detail for later.

Reference apps have 74,942 user ratings on average, but it's actually the Bible and Dictionary.com which skew up the average rating:


```python
for app in appstore_free:
    if app[-5] == 'Reference':
        print(app[1], ':', app[5])
```

However, this niche seems to show some potential. One thing we could do is take another popular book and turn it into an app where we could add different features besides the raw version of the book. This might include daily quotes from the book, an audio version of the book, quizzes about the book, etc. On top of that, we could also embed a dictionary within the app, so users don't need to exit our app to look up words in an external app.

This idea seems to fit well with the fact that the App Store is dominated by for-fun apps. This suggests the market might be a bit saturated with for-fun apps, which means a practical app might have more of a chance to stand out among the huge number of apps on the App Store.

Other genres that seem popular include weather, book, food and drink, or finance. The book genre seem to overlap a bit with the app idea we described above, but the other genres don't seem too interesting to us:

Weather apps — people generally don't spend too much time in-app, and the chances of making profit from in-app adds are low. Also, getting reliable live weather data may require us to connect our apps to non-free APIs.

Food and drink — examples here include Starbucks, Dunkin' Donuts, McDonald's, etc. So making a popular food and drink app requires actual cooking and a delivery service, which is outside the scope of our company.

Finance apps — these apps involve banking, paying bills, money transfer, etc. Building a finance app requires domain knowledge, and we don't want to hire a finance expert just to build an app.

Now let's analyze the Google Play market a bit.

## Most Popular Apps by Genre on Google Play
For the Google Play market, we actually have data about the number of installs, so we should be able to get a clearer picture about genre popularity. However, the install numbers don't seem precise enough — we can see that most values are open-ended (100+, 1,000+, 5,000+, etc.):


```python
display_table(googleplay_free, 5) # the Installs columns
```

    1,000,000+ : 15.726534296028879
    100,000+ : 11.552346570397113
    10,000,000+ : 10.548285198555957
    10,000+ : 10.198555956678701
    1,000+ : 8.393501805054152
    100+ : 6.915613718411552
    5,000,000+ : 6.825361010830325
    500,000+ : 5.561823104693141
    50,000+ : 4.7721119133574
    5,000+ : 4.512635379061372
    10+ : 3.5424187725631766
    500+ : 3.2490974729241873
    50,000,000+ : 2.3014440433213
    100,000,000+ : 2.1322202166064983
    50+ : 1.917870036101083
    5+ : 0.78971119133574
    1+ : 0.5076714801444043
    500,000,000+ : 0.2707581227436823
    1,000,000,000+ : 0.22563176895306858
    0+ : 0.04512635379061372

One problem with this data is that is not precise. For instance, we don't know whether an app with 100,000+ installs has 100,000 installs, 200,000, or 350,000. However, we don't need very precise data for our purposes — we only want to get an idea which app genres attract the most users, and we don't need perfect precision with respect to the number of users.

We're going to leave the numbers as they are, which means that we'll consider that an app with 100,000+ installs has 100,000 installs, and an app with 1,000,000+ installs has 1,000,000 installs, and so on.

To perform computations, however, we'll need to convert each install number to float — this means that we need to remove the commas and the plus characters, otherwise the conversion will fail and raise an error. We'll do this directly in the loop below, where we also compute the average number of installs for each genre (category).


```python
categories_android = freq_table(googleplay_free, 1)

for category in categories_android:
    total = 0
    len_category = 0
    for app in googleplay_free:
        category_app = app[1]
        if category_app == category:            
            n_installs = app[5]
            n_installs = n_installs.replace(',', '')
            n_installs = n_installs.replace('+', '')
            total += float(n_installs)
            len_category += 1
    avg_n_installs = total / len_category
    print(category, ':', avg_n_installs)
```

On average, communication apps have the most installs: 38,456,119. This number is heavily skewed up by a few apps that have over one billion installs (WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, Skype, Google Chrome, Gmail, and Hangouts), and a few others with over 100 and 500 million installs:


```python
for app in googleplay_free:
    if app[1] == 'COMMUNICATION' and (app[5] == '1,000,000,000+'
                                      or app[5] == '500,000,000+'
                                      or app[5] == '100,000,000+'):
        print(app[0], ':', app[5])

If we removed all the communication apps that have over 100 million installs, the average would be reduced roughly ten times:


```python
under_100_m = []

for app in googleplay_free:
    n_installs = app[5]
    n_installs = n_installs.replace(',', '')
    n_installs = n_installs.replace('+', '')
    if (app[1] == 'COMMUNICATION') and (float(n_installs) < 100000000):
        under_100_m.append(float(n_installs))
        
sum(under_100_m) / len(under_100_m)
```

We see the same pattern for the video players category, which is the runner-up with 24,727,872 installs. The market is dominated by apps like Youtube, Google Play Movies & TV, or MX Player. The pattern is repeated for social apps (where we have giants like Facebook, Instagram, Google+, etc.), photography apps (Google Photos and other popular photo editors), or productivity apps (Microsoft Word, Dropbox, Google Calendar, Evernote, etc.).

Again, the main concern is that these app genres might seem more popular than they really are. Moreover, these niches seem to be dominated by a few giants who are hard to compete against.

The game genre seems pretty popular, but previously we found out this part of the market seems a bit saturated, so we'd like to come up with a different app recommendation if possible.

The books and reference genre looks fairly popular as well, with an average number of installs of 8,767,811. It's interesting to explore this in more depth, since we found this genre has some potential to work well on the App Store, and our aim is to recommend an app genre that shows potential for being profitable on both the App Store and Google Play.

Let's take a look at some of the apps from this genre and their number of installs:


```python
for app in googleplay_free:
    if app[1] == 'BOOKS_AND_REFERENCE':
        print(app[0], ':', app[5])
```

The book and reference genre includes a variety of apps: software for processing and reading ebooks, various collections of libraries, dictionaries, tutorials on programming or languages, etc. It seems there's still a small number of extremely popular apps that skew the average:


```python
for app in googleplay_free:
    if app[1] == 'BOOKS_AND_REFERENCE' and (app[5] == '1,000,000,000+'
                                            or app[5] == '500,000,000+'
                                            or app[5] == '100,000,000+'):
        print(app[0], ':', app[5])
```

However, it looks like there are only a few very popular apps, so this market still shows potential. Let's try to get some app ideas based on the kind of apps that are somewhere in the middle in terms of popularity (between 1,000,000 and 100,000,000 downloads):


```python

for app in googleplay_free:
    if app[1] == 'BOOKS_AND_REFERENCE' and (app[5] == '1,000,000+'
                                            or app[5] == '5,000,000+'
                                            or app[5] == '10,000,000+'
                                            or app[5] == '50,000,000+'):
        print(app[0], ':', app[5])
```

This niche seems to be dominated by software for processing and reading ebooks, as well as various collections of libraries and dictionaries, so it's probably not a good idea to build similar apps since there'll be some significant competition.

We also notice there are quite a few apps built around the book Quran, which suggests that building an app around a popular book can be profitable. It seems that taking a popular book (perhaps a more recent book) and turning it into an app could be profitable for both the Google Play and the App Store markets.

However, it looks like the market is already full of libraries, so we need to add some special features besides the raw version of the book. This might include daily quotes from the book, an audio version of the book, quizzes on the book, a forum where people can discuss the book, etc.

## Conclusion

In this project, we analyzed data about the App Store and Google Play mobile apps with the goal of recommending an app profile that can be profitable for both markets.

We concluded that taking a popular book (perhaps a more recent book) and turning it into an app could be profitable for both the Google Play and the App Store markets. The markets are already full of libraries, so we need to add some special features besides the raw version of the book. This might include daily quotes from the book, an audio version of the book, quizzes on the book, a forum where people can discuss the book, etc.
